        <h2>Tuxie's Story</h2>
        <p>
            <article>
                November 25th 2020 - We lost our best boy yesterday night. We have been worried about Tuxie for about a week and a half now,<br> 
                because he started breathing through his mouth. He had been placed on a steroid and antibiotics for congestion before, <br>
                but that ultimately never caused such respiratory distress. We took him to the ER vet in Indianapolis on Monday the 23rd, and xrays showed nothing, <br>
                but he was oxygenated, which seemed to help, and they scheduled us to come up for a rhinoplasty and a CT scan to get the bottom of everything. <br>
                We were hopeful. The next day, he wasn't better. The steroid wasn't helping him breathe, and we brought him back to the ER. <br>
                We were told they would intubate him to see what was wrong. <br><br>
                But then, the doctor found a mass in Tuxie's throat that kept them from intubating, and was keeping him from breathing. <br>
                The oxygen chamber wasn't helping this time. We were told it would be a bad idea to bring him home, and our options were to leave him for several days <br>
                until they could do a risky surgery that would probably leave him with a trach ring, or he would not survive at all. <br>
                But he would most likely not even make it through the night. We came to see him and it was terrible, his jaw was wide open and he was gasping for air. <br>
                We decided to let him go, and stop his suffering while we could be there to say I'm Sorry, Goodbye, We Love You, Thank You, <br>
                and we hope he had a good dream as he was put under and passed on. The woman said "He has his wings now". <br>
                We sobbed all night, all day. We miss our Tuxie boy. We only had a year and a half with him, and we did our best to love him and help him get healthy. <br>
                He was taken from us so quickly, and we will have a tux shaped hole in our hearts for the rest of our lives. <br>
                Thank you buddy, for being here for me when I needed a buddy so bad. We will bury your ashes in the yard, so you can always be outside like you loved so much.  <br>
                We are going to miss your purring, like a car alarm and completely unique. The sounds you made when you ate or drank. <br>
                Taking you outside so you could feel the breeze and sniff the air, looking at the birds. Doing a grippy when we'd put our fingers in your paw. <br>
                Waddling toward us with your bowleggies. This feels so unfair, I hope you are in a better place now, with no pain, and you know we will always love you. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
I'm Sorry, Goodbye, We Love You, Thank You
        </p>
        <p>
Rest in Peace Tuxedo Blazimus <br>
